Your task is to evaluate ozone pollution across various regions.\n\nYou‚Äôve obtained data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), containing daily ozone measurements at monitoring stations across California. However, like many real-world datasets, it‚Äôs far from clean: there are missing values, inconsistent formats, potential duplicates, and outliers.\n\nBefore you can provide meaningful insights, you must clean and validate the data. Only then can you analyze it to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, and assess where policy interventions are most urgently needed.","metadata":{},"id":"b1684a8d-c5a7-4596-bfe4-b37c611971d7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## üíæ The data\nThe data is a modified dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data)). \n\n#### Ozone contains the daily air quality summary statistics by monitor for the state of California for 2024.
